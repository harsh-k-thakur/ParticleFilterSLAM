# ParticleFilterSLAM

In this project, I have implemented Particle Filter for mapping the free space of the world. 

The data I have used for this is available on my [google drive](). 
There are multiple data that is used to create this peoject. 

  1. IMU 
  2. Encoder
  3. LiDAR 
  4. Stereo

And as this is a robotics project, the rotation and transformation of the each particle are given in the [param]('/data/param/') folder of this repository.
This would help to locate the position of different sensor on my autonomous car.

The report for this project is available [here]('/Report/Particle Filter SLAM for creating the MAP.pdf').
